  - _"I had a multi-email exchange with someone in the media this morning---a name you would know---who is telling me that **there are people close to the Clintons who says WJC's sex life could be damaging to her**. I responded that I totally disagree with that, that WJC's presidency and his personal appeal are huge assets and that I do not believe people who are the closest to the Clintons believe what this person in the media is hearing from somebody."_

# Clinton Foundation / Foreign donations

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2874 _(November 13, 2011)_
  - _"I'm also starting to worry that **if this story gets out, we are screwed**. Dk and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has almost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could care a less about cgi."_

  - _"Late last night, laura graham called me as she couldn't reach my brother or her shrink. She was on staten island in her car parked a few feet from the waters edge with her foot on the gas pedal and the car in park. She called me to tell me **the stress of all of this office crap with wjc and cvc as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge** and she couldn't take it anymore. I spent a while on the phone with her preventing her from doing that, as I have a few times in the past few months, and was able to reach roger and her shrink."_

# Duplicity

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927 _(April 24, 2013)_
  - _"You just have to sort of figure out how to -- getting back to that word, "balance" -- how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that's not just a comment about today. That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But **if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position**. And finally, I think -- I believe in evidence-based decision making. I want to know what the facts are. I mean, it's like when you guys go into some kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know, you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what's going to work and what's not going to work."_ - Speech to National Multi-Housing Councel, April 24, 2013
- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3990 _(March 13, 2016)_
  - _"Beyond this Hillary should stop attacking Bernie, especially **when she says things that are untrue, which candidly she often does**. I am one of the people with credibility to suggest Bernie people support her in November, and she and Benenson and others have no idea of the damage she does to herself with these attacks, which she does not gain by making."_
  - Sent by [Brent Budowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Budowsky)
- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5423 _(March 20, 2016)_
  - _"So here's my idea. Bernie and his people have been bitching about super delegates and the huge percentage that have come out for Hillary. Since the original idea was to bring our elected officials to the convention ex-officio ( because of the offices and the constituencies they represent), **why not throw Bernie a bone** and reduce the super delegates in the future to the original draft of members of the House and Senate, governors and big city mayors, eliminating the DNC members who are not State chairs or vice-Chairs. (Frankly, **DNC members don't really represent constituencies anyway. I should know.** I served on the DNC first as Executive Director and then as an elected member for 10 years.) **So if we "give" Bernie this in the Convention's rules committee, his people will think they've "won" something from the Party Establishment. And it functionally doesn't make any difference anyway. They win. We don't lose. Everyone is happy.**"_

# Gay marriage

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2631 _(October 25, 2015)_
  - _"I think everyone agrees we shouldn't restate her argument. Question is whether she's going to agree to explicitly disavow it. And I doubt it."_ ("it" here are her comments on DOMA)
  - _"I'm not saying double down or ever say it again. I'm just saying that she's not going to want to say she was wrong about that, given **she and her husband believe it** and have repeated it many times. Better to reiterate evolution, opposition to DOMA when court considered it, and forward looking stance."_
  - Hillary Clinton is privately against gay marriage

# Globalism 

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927
  - _"My dream is a **hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders**, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere."_ - Remarks to Banco Itau, May 16, 2013
  - _"Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it's not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and **we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade** and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one."_ - Remarks to Banco Itau, May 16, 2013

# ISIS

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774
  - _"This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on **the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region**._
  - From Hillary Clinton, acknowledging the the Saudi Arabian government (not just wealthy individuals) is actively funding ISIS

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927
  - _“So our system is, in many ways, more difficult, certainly far more expensive and much longer than a parliamentary system, and I really admire the people who subject themselves to it. Even when I, you know, think they should not be elected president, I still think, well, you know, good for you I guess, you're out there promoting democracy and those crazy ideas of yours. So I think that it's something -- I would like -- you know, obviously as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to last as long because I think it's very distracting from what we should be doing every day in our public business. I would like it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I mean, in my campaign -- I lose track, but I think I raised $250 million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign President Obama raised 1.1 billion, and **that was before the Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in**, and it's so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with all of this **financial interest at stake**, but, you know, the Supreme Court said that's basically what we're in for. So we're kind of in the wild west, and, you know, **it would be very difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of money and without having other people supporting you because your opponent will have their supporters**. So I think as hard as it was when I ran, I think it's even harder now.”_ - Speech for General Electric's Global Leadership Meeting, January 6, 2014
- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6353 _(July 8, 2015)_
  - _"They also happy to have Sen Udall engage publicly/email/**direct mail to raise money etc for Sec Clinton** if desired."_
  - _"They, together and separately, would like to be **engaged in policy conversations with appropriate Clinton campaign team esp around energy and climate issues**."_
  - Mark Udall and Maggie fox are happy to help raise money for Hillary! (But their backs are itchy)

Cummings is helpful as is AP.** I do think that if Hillary doesn't speak to this today, people will assume she's guilty though. With normal people, if you are accused of being a criminal, they expect you to deny it pronto."_

# Racism, racial politics

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6195
  - _"This is great. My edits are attached. **The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man**, so arguably - this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. **Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated**? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis._"

  - _" I know you were probably kidding this morning about me in NH. I am aware of your dark sense of humor. But I should say that **I would do whatever Hillary needs always**. I owe her a lot. And **I'm a loyal soldier**. I think I might not be so useful because I overly focus on the lessons of the past but **if there's something I should do to help campaign more I will do it**.

  - Sent the night of the New Hampshire primary (possibly what "bad nite" refers to)

# Wall Street

- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927
  - _"That was one of the reasons that I started traveling in February of '09, so people could, you know, literally yell at me for the United States and our banking system causing this everywhere. Now, that's an oversimplification we know, but it was the conventional wisdom. And I think that **there's a lot that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding and really politicizing what happened** with greater transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know, what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? You guys help us figure it out and let's make sure that we do it right this time. And I think that everybody was desperately trying to fend off the worst effects institutionally, governmentally, and there just wasn't that opportunity to try to sort this out, and that came later."_ - Speech to Goldman Sachs, October 24, 2013
  - _"Well, **I represented all of you for eight years**. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and **a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it**, but I do -- I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in '08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world._ - Speech to Goldman Sachs, October 24, 2013
  - _"Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn't want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood. **Today, there's more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself**, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that's increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt's square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job."_ - Speech to Deutsche Bank, October 7, 2014
  - _"I mean, it's still happening, as you know. People are looking back and trying to, you know, get compensation for bad mortgages and all the rest of it in some of the agreements that are being reached. There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And **the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry**. And I think there has to be a recognition that, you know, there's so much at stake now, I mean, the business has changed so much and decisions are made so quickly, in nano seconds basically. We spend trillions of dollars to travel around the world, but it's in everybody's interest that we have a better framework, and not just for the United States but for the entire world, in which to operate and trade.”_  - Speech to Deutsche Bank, October 7, 2014
  - _"When I was a Senator from New York, I represented and worked with so many talented principled people who made their living in finance. But even though **I represented them and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper**, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay. I also was calling in '06, '07 for doing something about the mortgage crisis, because I saw every day from Wall Street literally to main streets across New York how a well-functioning financial system is essential. So when I raised early warnings about early warnings about subprime mortgages and called for regulating derivatives and over complex financial products, I didn't get some big arguments, because people sort of said, no, that makes sense. But boy, have we had fights about it ever since."_ - Speech at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd in San Diego, September 4, 2014
- https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5512 _(January 6, 2016)_
  - _"We don't need to prove he's bad on Wall Street-- that's not really credible. We need to prove we're ok. **Most of all, we don't want this fight.**"_
  - _"If you want to make the question of the campaign, **who will best stand up to Wall Street, Sanders is the answer** and he'll give you $35 million reasons why."_
  - Clinton camp knows she's weak on Wall Street, doesn't want it to be a central campaign issue
